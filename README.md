# CommunityCoin
Our team hoped to build a project to benefit the entire community while utilizing technologies such as the Verbwire API. One of the largest problems with modern-day community service is lack of interest, and we realized that we could incentivize people of our generation through the usage of NFTs and a reward system.

## What it does
Community Coin is a platform that gamifies community service, making it more attractive to people of a younger age. Users can create community service tasks, such as cleaning parks or donating to charities, and other users can participate and complete these tasks. An AI model determines the difficulty of the tasks based on their descriptions. When these tasks are both completed by the users and verified by the task creators, the platform generates an NFT (non-fungible token) for the participants. These NFTs are of varying levels of scarcity, and the value of a NFT is determined randomly, but the probability that the NFT will be scarce is higher if the task was more difficult. Users can combine these NFTs to create more valuable NFTs, trade with each other, and sell/buy these NFTs with real-world money.

# How It Works
## Login/Signup
Users are greeted with a login/signup page. If account exists, they may log in normally. If they are new to the application, the user has the option to sign up. They can choose to sign up as a local community company (Park, Beach) or a community user.

Error messages will display referencing the mistake the user makes with password or email.

## Company Side - Create a Task
Companies can create tasks via create task button on dashboard, specifying a title, description and deadline. Once submitted, they will await for someone to finish the task and they may verify to reward helper with a NFT

## User Side - Pick Up tasks
On user dashboard, they may view all tasks they have picked up and completed. Right side of their dashboard displays all available tasks looking for user help. They may add these tasks under their responsibilities.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced several challenges during the development process, including using new technologies, understanding public demand, and balancing the workload among team members.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have built a platform that could potentially encourage younger people to engage in community service. Additionally, we are proud to have utilized new technologies such as NFTs and AI models to create an innovative solution.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned how to use new technologies such as the Verbwire API and how to utilize AI models to determine the difficulty of tasks. We also learned about the challenges that come with balancing a team's workload and understanding public demand.

## What's next for Community Coin
We hope to continue improving our platform by adding new features such as a more comprehensive NFT marketplace and social features. Additionally, we hope to work on marketing and increasing public interest in the platform to encourage more people to engage in community service.
